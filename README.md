Keybored
========

mirrorboard_righty.klc is a Windows keyboard layout I created when I was
on doctor's orders not to use my left hand to type for a few days. It can be
converted into Windows DLLs and setup files by using Microsoft Keyboard Layout

Errata
======

The original layout lacked a mapping from lowercase p -> q, which I have added,
but have not tested. Other errors may exist.
